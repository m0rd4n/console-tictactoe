# Tic-Tac-Toe (console)
This is just a simple Tic-Tac-Toe without any GUI.

Rules are like in normal Tic-Tac-Toe. 

The positions you can enter are like on a numpad,
if you don't have one you can use the following "grid":
```
7 | 8 | 9
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
1 | 2 | 3
```

### Requirements:
- [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
